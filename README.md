# Network-Intrusions-Detection

Business Objective:
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of
applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly more important. All the
computer systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both technically difficult and
economically costly to be solved by the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is
becoming more important.
The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misusebased
detection techniques for a long time. While misuse-based detection is generally favoured in
commercial products due to its predictability and high accuracy, in academic research anomaly
detection is typically conceived as a more powerful method due to its theoretical potential for
addressing novel attacks.
As part of this project, your task is to build network intrusion detection system to detect anomalies
and attacks in the network.
There are two problems:
Binomial classification: Detect anomalies by predicting Activity is normal or attack
Multinomial Classification: Detecting type of activity by predicting Activity is Normal or Back or
Buffer Over flow or FTP Write or Guess Password or Neptune or N-Map or Port Sweep or Root Kit or
Satan or Smurf

Available Data:
Organization captured the data over the period of time for different types of attacks and provided
the data in different files for different type of activities along with normal.
